    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>Sitting in the front seat you contemplate whether you should go through with your original plan.  You buckle your seat belt, turn the key, and the engine roars to life.  You brace yourself for the impending impact.  Shifting into first gear, your foot becomes heavy and presses the gas pedal down as far as it can go.  Accelerating at maximum power, you speed through the gate.  The impact launches you forward, but your seat belt hold you back. Youâ€™ve successfully forced your way through the gate.</P>
