    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You lay down quietly in your small bed, the rough texture of your bindings made sleeping difficult and painful, so alternatives seemed like a better idea. To fight off the boredom you peer through the small glass opening that exposed the large room which contained all of the institutions rooms. It seemed odd that there had only been a few doors, considering that a lot of money and effort had been put into this institution Your brief pondering was interrupted by the sudden sensation of drowsiness. You knew it would be painful but you couldn’t keep waiting for hours.
