    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
    You walk back into the padded room you were in before, finding the same nurse standing and conversing with the large men you had seen previously. They appear to be arguing amongst themselves about a cut in pay which had occurred recently among the doctors and nurses. The woman noticing you crouches down and speaks to you. “Hello sport, you feeling down again? Ready to take your medicine?”
    </P>
