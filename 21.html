    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You slowly awaken from your unconscious state, feeling a sharp headache set over with each swift movement of your head. As you sit up you see the same foam room you had been in previously, though it seemed extremely pristine and clean. You attempt to reach for doorway to find that you are wearing what appears to be a straight jacket and the door was slammed closed. You struggle for a few seconds to stand while your arms are restrained, eventually succeeding and walking towards the door.
