    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You open your mouth to speak only to find that your voice is not coming out correctly, only being released every few seconds in squeeks and hobbled screeches. The nurse walks towards you and pats your head.“I heard you making a lot of noise in your room… did you have another nightmare?” She waited a few moments as you attempt to speak once more to no avail.“Oh my, I do believe you have gone a few days without your medication, Marie told me that you had been slipping it under your tongue. Well this is the consequences of you being stubborn.” She said with a peeved yet concerned look, she then extended her hands into the pill bottle fetching a few. “Right now is your break time, but come see me again if you are in need of the medication. Regardless I want you back here in ten minutes for another dose if you chose not to come early. Be safe.” The men lead you out the door, and as you turned to the left and right the room you had been in previously was completely clean and sterile and booming with more nurses and doctors racing around.</P>
