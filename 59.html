    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
As you follow the large footprints deep into the woods you find they stop at the large drooping tree you saw earlier. As you begin to walk past it you hear a loud rattling noise in the bushes beside you, followed by a low pitch humming sound growing closer from the bush. Suddenly a large beast cloaked in an aura of shadows begins to crawl towards you standing more and more upright as it gets closer. You try your best to run, but the large lankey arms of the beast grip onto your leg before you can do so. It presses its face close to you as you feel sharp waves of pain radiate through your abdomen.</P>
