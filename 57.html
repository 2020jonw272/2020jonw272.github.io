    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You struggle with your straight jacket until it loosens allowing you to grip your hand quickly around the doorknob and twist, pushing open the large door to expose the outside. The chilling air pushes past you as the dark night sky fills your eyes. As you look out into the distance, once again a large stalwart gate, now devoid of rust and moss protrusions stands around forteen meters from you. You feel a dark omen as you step towards the side of the gate, trying to walk around the perimeter may lead to being caught by security. Though it seems odd that you didnâ€™t see any in the first place.
