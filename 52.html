    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You walk through the thick green mist which permeates your view, down the long hall, the sound of shouting doctors and nurses muffled and quiet compared to the creaking of wheelchairs that surrounds you. As you pass to the end of the hall you noticed the door you originally entered through along with a sharp turn that leads to another hall next to it.
    </P>
