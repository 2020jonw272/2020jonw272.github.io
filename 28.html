    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
    You walk forward through the hallway finding a familiar fire escape door now shut and locked. A cold breeze blows through a small ornate window facing you as you walk up to the door next to it. You hear soft sounds of giggling past the door as you grow closer, which seems to be synchronized with another person behind the inch thick door.
    </P>
