    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You step into a long hallway with a fire escape at the end. As you approach it, it begins to emanate an odd duet of screeching noises echo through the hall, causing a swift wind to blow the contents of a dormant desk, obscured by the rubble towards you. As the screeching becomes louder and louder with each second you shamble around attempting to stand but to no avail. A small burnt piece of paper sticks to your face as the world around you begins to spin and go black.
