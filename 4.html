    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You take a deep breath in deciding to sit back in the car instead. Letting the dusty air of the forest around you dissipate in your air conditioner, until a slight chill began to appear. You knew that the gas in your car would not be able to get you back home, plus who would want to miss an opportunity such as this?
