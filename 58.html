    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You reach your hand forward to climb the fence, griping at and inching your way up until you eventually vault over it. It seemed to take a lot of effort to do so and you doubt you could do it again. In front of you footprint trails lead right into the forest, ending at a large willow tree. Alternatively traveling down the road may work too, though if you are searched for you will be easily found out.    </P>
