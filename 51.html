    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You quickly rise up and rush towards the door as it slammed shut, attempting to sigh as you peer through the small glass window which showed the room you had been in previously. As you continue to stare out your room begane to fade to a dark shade of lime fog, the window being the only illumination that could be discerned from the mist. A loud scraping sound can be heard, emanating from behind the window you had been looking through. As the view in the window becomes dark you hear a soft whisper behind you. “Stay still please.”
