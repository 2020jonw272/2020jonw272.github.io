    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
    You attempt to speak only to be found by an awkward silence that continues to purvey the room. You thought if the idea to write what you wanted to say, but with your arms bound and its apparent lack of sensory organs this would likely be impossible. The being whose skin appears to be thick like bark extends a finger towards you slowly. It presses on the base your neck which you are unable to see from your current position and you find yourself able to speak. In a garbled scratchy voice you say “Wh..Who are y-you?” The being responds almost immediately “Ich bin das Mädchen, das im Tank lebt. John, du scheinst jeden Tag zu vergessen, ich bin es leid, mich wieder einführen zu müssen.” You stood baffled as once more you understood nothing but one word, John.
