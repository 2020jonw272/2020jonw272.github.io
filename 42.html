    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
As you turn to face this new hallway, you feel a soft hand grip onto your shoulder, it had been the man standing guard at the entrance. He gave you a soft smile as he spoke “Hey chap, this wing is where we conduct operations, it's for authorized personnel only. I’ll let you through this one time, but I don’t want to see you end up like the last kid who tried to enter the basement so stay safe.” You walk forward, though the sheer emptiness of this operation wing seemed odd.
