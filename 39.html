    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
Mrs. Fuller placed one of her skinny hag-like fingers on your neck, they were cold to the touch. As she did so you felt the air in your lungs being able to form into raspy words “Please let me out.” you spoke softly. She sighed and let her finger go, she spoke in a witchy voice “Good god, the only reason I keep you and your brat friend here is on a direct order from Mayor Stewart, obviously he sees something in you degenerates that I don’t. If you want to escape I heard there's a furnace downstairs that one of the other midgets threw himself in.” At that moment I recognised the witch as the woman who usually gave me my doses.
