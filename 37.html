    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
  The nurse sighs as you back up away from her, the two large men you had seen before wrapping their arms around yours as you attempt to struggle free. The nurse walking forwards places a melting tablet in your mouth which dissolves before you are able to spit it out. You begin to cough profusely as the world around you begins to bend and contort, eventually becoming a shade of sickly green. The nurse wipes your saliva off of her finger as she walks out. “I think it’s time for you to rest again, you obviously are in need of treatment as soon as possible.” The men lay you on the bed as they shut the door locking you inside your padded cell.
    </P>
