    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>The rusted gate before you stood tall and mighty, adorned with meter high spikes to ward off against those attempting to climb it. The bars had been chained together with moss and vegetation, though plants appeared to be very scarce behind it. You took out your wire cutters only to notice a slim crevice in the gate that could possibly be traversed through.
