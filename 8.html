    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You quickly pass through the blown open entrance way into a long hallway. The hall appears battred and ruined, with dust kicking up into the air with every step. The walls around you are torn revealing exposed chunks of plaster and ventilation shafts. Far in the distance is a small barricade which consists of broken couches and chairs, formed into one mass. In the middle of the hallway appears a chair, adorning an odd frowning face no doubt added by hoodlums looking for a laugh. Windows appear on both sides of you, some broken, and others obscured with dust and ash.</P>
