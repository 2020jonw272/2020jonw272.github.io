    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You stand back, struggling against the orange straight jacket that has been fitted onto you to no avail. You yell out in frustration as you are unable to rip open the jacket, though the screaming begins to attract the attention of people outside the door in front of you. You hear footsteps growing louder with each moment you continue to writhe, culminating in the door slamming open. Before you stands a nurse with a concerned look on her face, quickly jotting notes on a small clipboard in her hand. Behind her stands three gargantuan men, covered in a dark navy blue wielding a baton in their hands. You know not who they are but still feel an extreme sense of dread as they approach you.</P>
