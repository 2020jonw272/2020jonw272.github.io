    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
 As your gaze locks past the window you see in the distance a large willow tree which appears to be drooping to the left. Next to it sits a large creature which shifts its attention to you as well. Its long soaking hair droops at its side much like the tree that accompanies it. You are being watched, and that feeling causes you to look away from the window.
