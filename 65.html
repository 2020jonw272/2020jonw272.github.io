    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
 Walking forward, the groans and gasps continue to barate your ears as you pass by a few rooms, coming across a caged door at the end. The door which in contrast to the clean walls around it remained rough and damaged. You press against the door, opening it before you. As you step in you shut it behind you, the only way left now is a long decrepit stairway that leads as far down as the eye can see. Your footsteps echo throughout the building and through the hollow walls as you descend.
