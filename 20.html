    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>Walking back towards the barricade you hear a soft humming which begins to become progressively louder, the noticeable scenes you had become so accustomed to while traveling here seem to almost dissipate around you as the humming overtakes your eardrums. Instinctively you pull backwards, tripping back as your balance becomes feeble and unreliable. As you slam your head against the ground the world around you fades into darkness.
