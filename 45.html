    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You walk past the nurse into the room you had been in before, finding the light green tint not being the only difference inside the room. The small figure laying on the floor had been replaced with a large metal tube which crookedly held a skeletal frame inside, with only the soft pale head poking out. It was a woman, clad in a blue polka dotted dress being tended to by a nurse. Every few seconds a loud clanking sound accompanied the rough noise emanating from the machine. It sounded as if a small plastic bag had been being filled with air, reaching its maximum capacity and squealing as the excess air released from a tube on the side, it was chilling.
