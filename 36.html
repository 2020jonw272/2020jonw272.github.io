    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
  You lean forward as the nurse places a small red pill in your mouth, after a few seconds it dissolves, which must be some measure to protect against people trying to hide the medication under the tongue. As it finishes dissolving you feel an extreme burst of nausea fall over you as the world around you feels as if it is constantly shifting from left to right. The bright light emanating from all around the room become a faint shade of putrid green, though at first the change startles you, it seems to send a wave of calmness through you as the nurse speaks once more in a deeper sounding voice “Would you like to go to bed in your room once more or shall I let you roam again?”
