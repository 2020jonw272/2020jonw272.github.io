	<P> You walk up to it and touch the back of its shoulder to get its attention. It tuned unnaturally quickly to face you, staring deeply into your eyes while shaking profusely. It’s eyes were hollowed and empty, creating a large cavity where they would be originally. It wore a striped grey shirt, with a small dress which lead down to dark black dress shoes which resonated with its flowing silver hair. Its face was permanently fixed in sad and disappointed features. It coughed loudly and in a light voice spoke to you. “magst du mein spielzeug?” it asked you blushing slightly, you understood none of her speech though the way she asked intrigued you. You noticed next to it stood a large metal cylinder, filled to the brim with several complex gears and curved glass components that show a padded interior.</P>
