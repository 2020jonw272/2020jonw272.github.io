    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You walk up to the open door and walk down a linear hallway to a corner where a window is visible and a fire escape door is open. As you walk up to it you find that some force repels you back as you attempt to walk through the door. Every time you try to press forward you feel a deep pain in your abdomen flare up.
</P>
