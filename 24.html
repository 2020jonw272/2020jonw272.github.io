    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>Remaining quiet you let the men and the nurse walk up to you and sigh, the nurse says “I heard you making a lot of noise in your room… did you have another nightmare?” She waits a few seconds as you don't respond, talking once more. “Oh my, I do believe you have gone a few days without your medication, Marie told me that you had been slipping it under your tongue. Well this is the consequences of you being stubborn.” She said with a peeved yet concerned look, she then extended her hands into the pill bottle fetching a few. “Right now is your break time, but come see me again if you are in need of the medication. Regardless I want you back here in ten minutes for another dose if you chose not to come early. Be safe.” The men lead you out the door, and as you turned to the left and right the room you had been in previously was completely clean and sterile and booming with more nurses and doctors racing around.</P>
