	<h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>On a warm summer day as dusk approaches the horizon a young man pulls into a building that would become his new home. Not home in the sense of abode, as he had left that in search of something new, of something otherworldly. This place, which was formerly known as Hope County Asylum, will become his permanent residence as he traverses through it and becomes entangled in a web of illusion and deception. Find out the identity of those around you and question reality itself and the fragile bones that surround it as you journey to your ultimate fate. Escaping may seem easy, though you will find quite quickly that even the psychotic visions that fill the air around you are chaotic and malevolent at best, and maddeningly horrific at worse. Decide whether to follow the paths laid out in front of you, or to work alongside other mutated inhabitants to an ultimate goal of inconceivable bliss through psychic destruction. Unearth the horrific tragedies that purvey the asylum in a Lapse of Sanity.</p>
