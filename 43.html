    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You walk up to the large british guard who stood in front of the exit to the building. He kneeled down to speak “Quite the young chap I see, you look like me thirty years ago!” He giggled to himself as you continued to stand there eyeing the door. “Oh no” he said, “I cannot let you out under any circumstances, its a direct order.”
