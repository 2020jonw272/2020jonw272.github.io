    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You peer through the window, which exposed a full and lush forest outside of the institution. Shadows flicker around a specific tree in the distance, though you cannot appear to make anything out. The leaves of the tree droop down a good foot in contrast to those surrounding it giving a dense aura of unease.
