    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
    You step back looking around closer at the long hallway that you had previous tread down what seemed like a few moment back. The once ruined and shattered windows had appeared completely new minus a few common scratches much like those that adorned the entrances and doorway across yours. The large couch which had been used as a barricade was now laying at the side of the room, in use by a few nurses obviously on break.
    </P>
