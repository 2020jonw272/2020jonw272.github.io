    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You creep forward attempting to bypass the gate by crawling through a hole in the side. As you inch further though it a stray piece of fence jabs you in the side causing you to become stuck for a few moments. You eventually wiggle out to the other side, seeing the entrance door blown open off its hinges and laying on the dirt around you. You can get a decent look of the inside hall of the facility.
