    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You attempt to lay back in your bed in a vail struggle to fall asleep, as you sit up and sign the green tint grows dark as the world around you fades A loud scraping sound can be heard, emanating from behind the window you had been looking through. As the view in the window becomes dark you hear a soft whisper behind you. “Stay still please.”

    </P>
