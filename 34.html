    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
    Stepping towards the couch you notice two nurses sitting and whispering amongst each other, their clipboards laying on the side of them. Noticing you they stand and pick up their clipboard once more, flipping through a few pages before stopping on one in particular. The shorter of the two nurses walked past me towards one of doors next to my original one, the other looked down and spoke. “Yes? What do you need?” As she spoke you felt a shiver run down your back as you noticed her name tag, “Marie Fuller” it read. For some reason this name resonated with you, though you could not remember why.
