    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
 You search around the side of the building, making your way around and reaching the parking lot on the other side. You walk up to a car only to realize the trunk is wide open, with a large white object sticking out the back. On the back of the object is a tag that reads “Failure 031”.
