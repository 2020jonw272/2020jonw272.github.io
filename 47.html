    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
You wait in the padded room, perched on the bed and searching around the walls looking for an escape. As you lay dormant you start to nod off only being interrupted by banging on the door. A doctor in a heavy german accent speaks to you. Though you are only able to understand a few words, the man seems intimidating in presence alone. The door is opened as you are quickly restrained and layed on a gurney and lead throughout the hall into a large room with a variety of instruments and tools beside you.
