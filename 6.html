    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You take your wire cutters and slice up the moss blocking the gateway, eventually stepping through the massive gateway and reaching the entrance. You see that the front door appears blown off its hinges and laying on the dirt around you. You can get a decent look of the inside hall of the facility.
