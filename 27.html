    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You take a moment to walk around this familiar yet oddly clean room, still unsure of what's going on. You see someone laying on the floor, couldn’t have been more than 17, though as tall as you are. It held in his hands an odd cube. It contained hundreds of increasingly small indents and holes inside. It looked completely absorbed in it and uninterested in you or his surroundings.</P>
