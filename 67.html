    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
 Looking into the trunk you see the object before you in greater detail. The object is in fact, a bathtub filled with a mysterious black liquid, there seems to be a figure moving slightly in the water, though only noticeable in good light. A hand extends from the bathtub and begins to pull you in as you see the figure clearly.
