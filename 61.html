    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
 As you stumble forward into the misty hallway you notice a large door in front of you, caged and filthy with multicolored stains on the handle. Reluctantly you press against it, opening it up to show a large descending stairwell. As you look down the dark mist clouds your vision past a few meters, though you still are able to travel down the stairs.
