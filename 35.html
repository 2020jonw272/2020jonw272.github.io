    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
   You walk past the two, eventually reaching the end of the hallway where the entrance you had entered through had previously been in. In front of it stood a tall guard, and next to it was a path that had been previously covered by rubble showed another long hall with varying sized rooms throughout it. In some you hear soft groans and painful moans while in others were purely silent. At the end of the hall was a small gated door which appeared to lead underground.
