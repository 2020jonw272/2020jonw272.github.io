    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>
The sudden softness of the voice behind you shifts as suddenly all around you can be heard the roaring of children, screaming and screeching as the lights flicker on. All around you are open doors, inside of which reaches out hundreds of long grey hands of varying length and shape grasping at you. A few quickly wrap around your arms and legs, pulling your body into different directions as more clasp on. The hands completely cover your body as you begin to black out. The voice of hundreds speak at once from all directions “The feeling you provide fills us with such joy, please let us return our gratitude…”

    </P>
