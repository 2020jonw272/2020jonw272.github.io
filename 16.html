    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You reer your leg back, slamming it against the door until it collapses. In front of you is a dark room composed entirely of broken foam padding which fills the floor and walls. In the back corner or the room is a small wooden chair which appears to be the only thing illuminated by the mostly broken lights on the ceiling. An aura of fear and familiarity grips your heart as you walk forward into the room.
