    <h3>A Lapse of Sanity</h3>
	<P>You peer through the small indent on the padded door to see three hulking men on the other side. They appear to be wearing a dark navy officer uniform with even darker jeans casting a shadow on the steel floor bellow. Behind them stands a short woman in white, holding a clipboard and a bottle of multicolored medicine tablets stored on a satchel on her waist. As you squint to get a better look your vision is obstructed by a key entering the hole you were using to see. Backing up the door slowly swings open, revealing the nurse and three men completely.
